# Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data Course
This script will merge the test and training data from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset, clean it up and then genarate a file containing the average of each measurements by activity and subject and saved it as `avfByActivityAndSubject.txt`

## Files
* **run_analysis.R** -- The R Script that manipulates the data
* **CodeBook.md** -- Code book describing the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that performed to clean up the data
* **dataset/** -- Folder containing the test and training data
* **avgByActivityAndSubject.txt** -- The resulting data set generated by the script

# Requirements
This script relies on the `dplyr` package
